Joiji: A Movie Rental App ðŸŽ¬
Welcome to Joiji, a movie rental application developed as part of the CS251 (Database System) course. This React application fetches a list of movies from an API and displays them in a grid layout, each represented by a poster image. The application includes a navigation bar and a menu bar, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing and renting movies.
